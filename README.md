# Leap Year Checker

This Python program checks whether a year is a leap year or not. Leap years have an extra day, February 29th. The rules for determining a leap year are as follows:

- A year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4.
- However, years divisible by 100 are not leap years, unless they are also divisible by 400.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the starting year from which you want to check for leap years.
3. Enter the number of years you want to check, starting from the specified year.

The program will then calculate and display whether each year within the specified range is a leap year or not.

## Example

Suppose you start with the year 2000 and want to check for leap years for the next 10 years. The program will display whether each year from 2000 to 2009 is a leap year or not.

## Output

```
What year do you want to start with: 2000
How many years do you want to check: 10

2000 is a leap year
2001 is not a leap year
2002 is not a leap year
2003 is not a leap year
2004 is a leap year
2005 is not a leap year
2006 is not a leap year
2007 is not a leap year
2008 is a leap year
2009 is not a leap year
```
